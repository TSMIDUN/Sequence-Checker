# Sequence-Checker
A Sequence Checker is a digital circuit that checks for a specific sequence of bits in a stream of input data. It is typically implemented using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and is widely used in various communication and data-processing systems to detect predefined patterns.

"We have implemented states in the design, ensuring that each state is indicated by a dedicated LED. For example, the states 01, 10, and 11 will each illuminate their respective LEDs, providing a clear visual notification. Additionally, the output is connected to a special LED to display the result when specific conditions are met. Furthermore, a separate LED has been designated to indicate the clock signal, ensuring real-time visibility of clock operations within the system."
